# Blob Inspector Tests

These tests exercise the blob inspector exe through comparison with the test files generated from the actual Java runtime.

## Keeping the tests up to date

As more test files are added, a list of those not being exercised here can be generated by running the test-checker script

``./test-checker.py``
